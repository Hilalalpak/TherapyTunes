# Therapy Tunes

Therapy Tunes is an innovative project exploring the intersection of music and mental health. Developed collaboratively by three colleagues, this platform offers personalized song recommendations aimed at enhancing users' emotional well-being.

## Project Objective

Our primary aim is to recommend songs that align with users' musical preferences while addressing their mental states. Therapy Tunes harnesses music's therapeutic potential to aid in managing common issues such as anxiety, depression, and insomnia.

## Operational Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gather user information to assess anxiety, depression, and insomnia levels, alongside musical preferences.

2. **BPM Determination**: Calculate an ideal BPM (Beats Per Minute) range based on collected data.

3. **Data Analysis**: Analyze an extensive song database using determined BPM and other parameters, employing clustering and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for song categorization.

4. **Song Recommendation**: Identify the most suitable song segment based on the user's profile and recommend songs accordingly.

5. **Astrological Integration**: Incorporate current horoscope interpretations, extracted via web scraping, to enhance song recommendations.
